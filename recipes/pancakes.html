    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A pancake is a type of batter bread that is often thin and round, prepared
      from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk, and butter and
      cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with
      oil or butter 1. The pancake’s shape and structure varies worldwide. In
      the United Kingdom, pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a crêpe. In
      North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder)
      creating a thick fluffy pancake. A crêpe is a thin Breton pancake of
      French origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker
      to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles. A well-known variation
      originating from southeast Europe is a palačinke, a thin moist pancake
      fried on both sides and filled with jam, cream cheese, chocolate, or
      ground walnuts, but many other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used
